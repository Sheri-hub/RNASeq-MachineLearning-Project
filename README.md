üêç Part 2 ‚Äî Python Machine Learning Analysis

This section continues the RNA-seq pipeline by applying machine learning to the DESeq2 results exported from R.
The goal was to classify samples based on their gene expression patterns using a Random Forest model and assess the performance with Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV).

Import Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, LeaveOneOut, cross_val_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

Load the Data
data = pd.read_csv('DESeq2_significant_results.csv', index_col=0)


Note: Make sure the file DESeq2_significant_results.csv (exported from R) is in your Python working directory.

data.shape
data.head()
data.info()

PCA Visualization of Significant Genes
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_result = pca.fit_transform(data.values)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.scatter(pca_result[:,0], pca_result[:,1], alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel('PC1')
plt.ylabel('PC2')
plt.title('PCA of RNA-seq Significant Genes')
plt.show()


Purpose: Visualizes how samples cluster based on gene expression variation.

Load and Prepare Normalized Counts
norm_counts = pd.read_csv('normalized_counts.csv', index_col=0)
norm_counts.shape
norm_counts.head()

# Transpose so rows = samples, columns = genes
norm_counts = norm_counts.T

Scale the Data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(norm_counts.values)
print(X_scaled.shape)

Purpose: Standardizes the features so each gene contributes equally to the analysis.

Split Data into Training and Test Sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_scaled, labels, test_size=0.25, random_state=42, stratify=labels
)


Note: labels should contain the biological condition for each sample (e.g., treated vs untreated).

Random Forest Model with LOOCV
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
loo = LeaveOneOut()

scores = cross_val_score(model, X_scaled, labels, cv=loo)
print("LOOCV Accuracy per sample:", scores)
print("Mean LOOCV Accuracy:", scores.mean())


Outcome:
LOOCV Accuracy per sample: [1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
Mean LOOCV Accuracy: 1.0


Interpretation: Perfect accuracy likely reflects overfitting due to the very small sample size (8 samples). The workflow demonstrates the concept, not a deployable model.

Learning Outcomes
Learned how to import DESeq2 results and integrate R ‚Üí Python workflows
Applied data preprocessing and scaling for ML
Used PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization
Built a Random Forest model and validated with Leave-One-Out Cross Validation
Understood overfitting issues in small biological datasets

Results Summary

The analysis successfully identified and visualized gene expression differences between dexamethasone-treated and control airway smooth muscle cells using DESeq2 and supporting Python tools.

Key Findings:
Differential Expression: Several genes were found to be significantly upregulated or downregulated after treatment, based on adjusted p-values and log2 fold change.
Data Distribution: Boxplots confirmed consistent normalization across samples.
MA Plot: Showed clear separation between genes with significant expression changes and those with minimal differences.
PCA Plot: Samples clustered according to treatment groups, confirming distinct transcriptional profiles.
Heatmap: Highlighted clusters of co-expressed genes, revealing potential gene groups affected by the treatment.
Machine Learning Validation: Random Forest classification achieved perfect prediction accuracy (Mean LOOCV Accuracy = 1.0), supporting the distinct expression patterns identified in the R analysis.
